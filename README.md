### Train Booking Management System

### Objective
This challenge is designed to help learners understand and implement database design principles, including:
1. Structuring tables for efficient data management.
2. Implementing relationships between tables.
3. Normalizing data to avoid redundancy and improve data integrity.
4. Creating queries to handle user requests (e.g., booking, viewing reservations).

Through this project, learners will build foundational knowledge in database management, preparing them for more advanced topics in software development and database administration.
